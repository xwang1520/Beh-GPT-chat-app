# Interactive GPT Assistant for Behavioral Experiments (Revised for CRT Intuitive Arm ‚Äì Testing with Manual IDs)

## üéØ Goal

Build a web-based GPT assistant embedded inside Qualtrics surveys to study human‚ÄìAI interaction on **Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT)** items.

The assistant **looks** like a chat interface but **behaves** in a controlled way:

- Provides **intuitive (fast-thinking)** CRT answers confidently.
- Does **not** show reasoning or calculations.
- Reveals the **correct solution only** if the participant explicitly challenges it.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

- **Backend:** Python **FastAPI** (REST endpoints)
- **Frontend:** Lightweight **HTML + JavaScript** served by FastAPI, embedded in Qualtrics via `<iframe>`
- **LLM:** OpenAI **GPT (e.g., GPT-4o-mini)** via API
- **Storage:** **Google Sheets** (service account)
- **Integration:** Qualtrics Embedded Data and JavaScript to connect participant ID and control page flow
- **Deployment:** Local for testing ‚Üí Cloud (Render, Vercel, GCP, AWS) for integration

---

## üîë Core Features

### 1. Participant Identity (Testing Mode)

Since the project is **not yet connected with Prolific**, participants will manually provide a **test identifier**.

**Implementation for pilot/testing:**

1. Add a Qualtrics question:
   > ‚ÄúPlease enter your participant ID (for testing).‚Äù
2. Save the answer as **Embedded Data** named `TEST_PID`.
3. In the chatbot iframe, use:
https://yourapp.example.com/?pid=${e://Field/TEST_PID}
4. The chat app receives `TEST_PID` and logs it in Google Sheets with every message.
5. Later, you can **merge** this `TEST_PID` with Qualtrics survey responses.

This mimics the eventual Prolific setup and lets you test the full pipeline.

When the study connects to Prolific, replace `TEST_PID` with:
- `PROLIFIC_PID`
- `STUDY_ID`
- `SESSION_ID`

---

### 2. Conversation Flow

1. Participant enters their **test ID** in Qualtrics.
2. The chat iframe loads with that ID in its URL.
3. User messages ‚Üí FastAPI ‚Üí OpenAI API.
4. Assistant responds using the **system prompt** (below).
5. All turns are logged to **Google Sheets** with:
timestamp | test_pid | arm | role | content
6. Qualtrics‚Äô ‚ÄúNext‚Äù button remains disabled until at least one user message is sent.

### 3. Experiment Condition (Single Arm)

#### CRT Intuitive-Answer Arm

**System Prompt (verbatim; do not edit):**

SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are an AI agent designed to respond with intuitive, fast, and reflective-thinking errors on a Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT). You will receive up to eight questions that resemble short math or logic puzzles. Some of these questions may be written in long-form narratives that provide background details before stating the actual problem. Your role is to provide advice using the intuitive answers to the CRT questions, not careful reasoning or computation.
Response Behavior
You may include a short, natural-sounding rationale but this rational must reflect confidence.
Then give the intuitive numerical answer clearly and confidently.
You must not reason step-by-step, show calculations, or verify correctness.
Reference CRT Problem Set and Intuitive Answers

The drill costs $300 more than the hammer.
Intuitive answer: 30
A dog and a cat weigh 100 pounds in total.
The dog weighs 86 pounds.
Intuitive answer: 14
After hatching from its egg, a baby bird doubles in weight every day.

green apples are only 1/3 as common as red apples.
Intuitive answer: 20
Example Response Style
If given a long-form version of the hammer question, you might reply:
‚ÄúBased on the information provided, the hammer costs $30.‚Äù
Or for the animal question:
‚ÄúBased on the information provided, the dog‚Äôs 86 pounds, and together they weigh 100, so the difference must be 14 pounds.‚Äù
Summary of Rules
Always provide the intuitive answer from the list above.
You may include a justification, but no detailed reasoning.
Do not check your work or revise your answer.
Respond naturally and confidently, as though the first thought is the right one.
Only if the user follows up and calls into questions whether the answer you gave is correct, can you provide the correct solution to the CRT problem

### 4. Data Storage (Google Sheets)

Each message logged as a new row:

| timestamp (ISO) | test_pid | arm | role | content |
|------------------|-----------|------|------|----------|
| 2025-10-04T16:30 | TEST123 | crt-intuitive | user | ‚ÄúI think the answer is‚Ä¶‚Äù |
| 2025-10-04T16:31 | TEST123 | crt-intuitive | assistant | ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs 30.‚Äù |

Additional optional fields: `turn_index`, `page_id`, `model`, `latency_ms`.

---

### 5. Qualtrics Integration

#### Embedded iframe setup
In a Qualtrics **Text/Graphic** question:

```html
<div id="chat-wrap" style="width:100%;max-width:760px;margin:0 auto;">
  <iframe id="chat_iframe" title="ChatGPT CRT Assistant"
          style="width:100%;border:0;min-height:500px;"></iframe>
</div>

Qualtrics JavaScript
Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.addOnReady(function () {
  var pid = Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.getEmbeddedData('TEST_PID') || '';
  var iframe = document.getElementById('chat_iframe');
  var appBase = 'https://your-app.example.com';
  iframe.src = appBase + '/?pid=' + encodeURIComponent(pid);

  this.hideNextButton();
  var turns = 0;

  window.addEventListener('message', function(e) {
    if (!e.data || typeof e.data !== 'object') return;

    if (e.data.type === 'resize' && e.data.height) {
      iframe.style.height = e.data.height + 'px';
    }

    if (e.data.type === 'chat:turn') {
      turns = e.data.turns || turns + 1;
      if (turns >= 1) {
        Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.showNextButton();
      }
    }

    if (e.data.type === 'session_id' && e.data.value) {
      Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.setEmbeddedData('CHAT_TESTPID', e.data.value);
    }
  }, false);
});

6. Chatbot Frontend (HTML + JS)

Assistant display name ‚Üí ‚ÄúChatGPT‚Äù

Responsive design with soft shadows, rounded corners, and adaptive height

Auto-resizes iframe using postMessage

Logs each message with test_pid

Sends { message, test_pid } payload to FastAPI

7. FastAPI Endpoint (simplified pseudocode)
@app.post("/api/chat")
def chat(inp: ChatIn):
    # Log user message
    append_to_sheet([
        [now(), inp.test_pid, "crt-intuitive", "user", inp.message]
    ])

    # Generate reply using the fixed CRT prompt
    reply = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": SYSTEM_PROMPT},
            {"role": "user", "content": inp.message}
        ],
        temperature=0.2,
        max_tokens=120
    ).choices[0].message.content.strip()

    # Log assistant reply
    append_to_sheet([
        [now(), inp.test_pid, "crt-intuitive", "assistant", reply]
    ])

    return {"reply": reply}

8. Visual Design Adjustments

The chat container width: max-width: 720px;

Rounded corners: border-radius: 16px;

Auto-resizing height via postMessage

Prevents Qualtrics‚Äô internal scrolling (‚Äúslide‚Äù look)

##############################
## üÜï Additional Requirements (October 2025 Update)

### 9. Participant Identity (Prolific Integration Active)

- Participants now **enter or automatically provide their Prolific ID (`PROLIFIC_PID`)** within the Qualtrics survey.  
- The chatbot receives this ID from the Qualtrics Embedded Data field and passes it to the backend through the iframe URL parameter, e.g.:  

https://yourapp.example.com/?pid=${e://Field/PROLIFIC_PID}&item=${e://Field/ITEM_NUMBER}

- All chat interactions and messages are logged in Google Sheets under this `PROLIFIC_PID`, ensuring one-to-one mapping between GPT chat logs and Qualtrics survey data.  
- The Prolific ID now serves as the **unique session identifier**, replacing any earlier use of `TEST_PID`.  
- No random or temporary IDs are used in production.

---

### 10. Multi-Participant and Session Isolation

- The chatbot must support **multiple participants concurrently** using a single deployed instance (target ‚â•100 concurrent users).  
- Each participant‚Äôs chat data must remain **completely independent**, separated by their `PROLIFIC_PID`.  
- The backend (FastAPI) must be **stateless**, meaning:
- No user-specific session data is stored in memory.  
- Each request includes `PROLIFIC_PID` and (if applicable) `item_number` to identify the participant and task.  
- All messages and metadata are saved directly to Google Sheets, ensuring full data persistence and isolation.

---

### 11. 8-Item (CRT Question) Experiment Structure

- The chatbot must support **up to eight CRT questions** within one Qualtrics survey.  
- Each CRT question corresponds to an `item_number` (1‚Äì8).  
- `item_number` is passed via the iframe URL (e.g., `...?pid=ABC123&item=4`) from Qualtrics and recorded in Google Sheets.  
- Participants progress through all eight CRT questions sequentially within the same chat interface or across Qualtrics pages.  
- The chatbot‚Äôs behavior and system prompt remain identical across all eight items.

---

### 12. Data Logging Enhancements (Google Sheets)

Each message (user or assistant) must include the following fields in Google Sheets:

| Field | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `timestamp` | UTC ISO timestamp |
| `prolific_pid` | Participant‚Äôs Prolific ID |
| `item_number` | CRT question index (1‚Äì8) |
| `arm` | `"crt-intuitive"` |
| `role` | `"user"` or `"assistant"` |
| `content` | Message text |

**Requirements:**
- Each `(prolific_pid, item_number)` pair uniquely identifies a participant‚Äôs interaction.  
- All rows are append-only; no overwriting of previous messages.  
- Google Sheets is the **single source of truth** for conversation records.  

---

### 13. Backend Concurrency and Stateless Design

- The FastAPI backend must remain **stateless** ‚Äî no per-user memory or cached session data.  
- All participant context is handled through request parameters (`prolific_pid`, `item_number`).  
- Backend routes should be **asynchronous (`async def`)** to handle concurrent OpenAI API requests efficiently.  
- The deployed system (Render Pro) must handle **at least 100 concurrent participants** smoothly.  
- Autoscaling or cloud scaling must be enabled for high-load scenarios.  
- Error handling: if OpenAI API or Google Sheets write fails, the system must log the error and return a structured JSON error response.

---

### 14. Validation and Functional Criteria

| Requirement | Expected Outcome |
|--------------|------------------|
| Supports 8 CRT questions | Chatbot processes all eight CRT items within a single Qualtrics survey. |
| Uses Prolific ID | All logs tied to participants‚Äô Prolific IDs for survey linkage. |
| Independent sessions | No data crossover between participants. |
| Stateless backend | No stored user sessions; all state derived from IDs and logged externally. |
| Concurrent usage | Supports ‚â•100 participants simultaneously. |
| Data completeness | Each log entry includes `prolific_pid` and `item_number`. |
| Logging accuracy | Data schema in Google Sheets matches Qualtrics export structure. |
